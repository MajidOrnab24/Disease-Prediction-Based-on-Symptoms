# Disease-Prediction-based-on-symptoms

## Introduction:

Advancing early disease detection by simplifying healthcare access and preserving lives through remote symptom-based assessment,
Enhancing disease prediction through an efficient machine learning framework utilizing symptom analysis

There are total 10 models used for accuracy crosschecking namely:

- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bias
- KNN
- SVM
- Decision Tree classifier
- Multilayer Perceptron Classifier
- Catboost
- Xgboost
- LGBM classifier

## Project Files
1.The main project is in the file named "Project_ML.ipynb
2.All the accuracy comparison is in the file named "Accuracy_crosschecking"

## All the pkl files are the saved trained models
